# FirstHTMLproject

This is a very **basic beginner project** built using only **HTML and inline CSS**.

🛠️ **Current Status:**
- Not responsive yet 📱❌
- Still in early development stages 🐣

🎯 **Purpose:**
I'm learning web development, and this is one of my first practical projects. I’m focusing on building layout structure and improving my understanding of HTML and CSS.

📌 **Notes:**
- The design and code will be improved as I continue learning.
